# Desk Adjustment Project
This repository contains all the code and circuit diagrams I designed and worked on for a personal project I worked on over the last few days. This includes a the code I have running through an Arduino in order to control the components in use, mainly the LCD screen and two servo motors, the final circuit diagrams created using Fritz and a few demonstration videos in this README.
